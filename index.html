        <p> 
        I am in second year at the IESEG school of management in Lille. I am a serious and involved student. I really like movies, cinema in general as well as sports, sneakers and sportswear. I also learned a lot by coding thanks to the wagon

        <h2>My passion : Sports and sneakers </h2>
        <p>
        I am a sports enthusiast, especially football. I have been playing soccer since I was 6 years old. At the same time, I have a large collection of sneakers and streetwear and I am passionate about each new pair that comes out on sale.

        <h2> My hobbies : Movies and series </h2>
        <p>
        I really like watching movies, analyzing scenarios. I'm really curious about the whole making of the final film. I like to create my own stories and imagine different endings for each movie and series I watch.

        <h2> My goals </h2>
        <p>
        My goal would be to succeed at IESEG, find a master that I like and then be able to work in a sector that interests me. I am lucky to be able to go to Warsaw next year in the 2nd semester on a university exchange. I am very excited to be able to discover a new language and a new way of life.
